timestamps:
  # Consumption data uses relative timestamps (ms from start)
  # This offset is added to the earliest task submission_time to get absolute timestamps
  consumption_offset_ms: 0  # No offset by default (align with earliest task)

  # Alternative: specify an absolute base timestamp
  # base_timestamp: "2022-10-06T22:00:00"
